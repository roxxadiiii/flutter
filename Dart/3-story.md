### Rewritten Code:
```dart
void main() {
  // Variable declarations
  String characterName = 'roxx'; // Character's name
  String characterAge = '35';     // Character's age

  // Printing story details using string interpolation
  print('There once was a man named ${characterName}');
  print('He was ${characterAge} years old');

  // Updating the character's name
  characterName = 'aaddiii';

  print('He really liked the name ${characterName}');
  print("But he didn't like being ${characterAge} years old");
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

#### 1. `void main()`
- The entry point of the Dart program.

#### 2. Variable Declarations
- **`String characterName = 'roxx';`**
  - Declares a variable `characterName` and initializes it with the string `'roxx'`.
  
- **`String characterAge = '35';`**
  - Declares another variable `characterAge` initialized with the string `'35'`. Although it represents an age, it's stored as a string for this context.

#### 3. Print Statements with String Interpolation
- **`print('There once was a man named ${characterName}');`**
  - Outputs a string where `${characterName}` is replaced with the value of the variable. This uses string interpolation to make the output dynamic.

- **`print('He was ${characterAge} years old');`**
  - Similar to the previous statement, this outputs the age.

#### 4. Updating Variable
- **`characterName = 'aaddiii';`**
  - Updates the value of `characterName` to `'aaddiii'`. In Dart, variables can be reassigned new values unless they are declared as `final` or `const`.

#### 5. More Print Statements
- **`print('He really liked the name ${characterName}');`**
  - Outputs the updated character name using string interpolation.

- **`print("But he didn't like being ${characterAge} years old");`**
  - Outputs a statement about the character's feelings regarding their age. Note that it uses single quotes within double quotes, which is valid in Dart.

### Dry Run: Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Program starts**: The Dart environment calls the `main()` function.
   
2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `characterName` is initialized to `'roxx'`.
   - `characterAge` is initialized to `'35'`.

3. **First Print Statement**:
   - Outputs: `There once was a man named roxx`.

4. **Second Print Statement**:
   - Outputs: `He was 35 years old`.

5. **Updating Variable**:
   - `characterName` is updated to `'aaddiii'`.

6. **Third Print Statement**:
   - Outputs: `He really liked the name aaddiii`.

7. **Fourth Print Statement**:
   - Outputs: `But he didn't like being 35 years old`.

8. **Program ends**: After executing all statements, the program finishes.

### Keywords and Concepts:
- **Variable Declaration**: The process of creating a variable and specifying its type.
- **String Interpolation**: A way to include variable values within strings by using `${}` syntax.
- **Updating Variables**: Changing the value of a variable after its initial assignment.

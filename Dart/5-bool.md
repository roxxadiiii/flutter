### Rewritten Code:
```dart
import 'dart:math';

void main(List<String> args) {
  // Comparing two numbers and printing the result
  print('Is 5 greater than 3? ${5 > 3}');
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

#### 1. `import 'dart:math';`
- This line imports the `math` library, though it's not used in this specific code snippet. It's useful for future mathematical functions you may want to include.

#### 2. `void main(List<String> args)`
- This is the entry point of the Dart program. The `main` function can take a list of command-line arguments, which is represented by `List<String> args`. In this case, you're not utilizing the arguments.

#### 3. Comparison Operation
- **`print('Is 5 greater than 3? ${5 > 3}');`**
  - The expression `5 > 3` evaluates to `true` since `5` is indeed greater than `3`.
  - The result (`true`) is then interpolated into the string and printed.

### Dry Run: Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Program starts**: The Dart environment calls the `main()` function.

2. **Comparison**:
   - The expression `5 > 3` is evaluated to `true`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - Outputs: `Is 5 greater than 3? true`.

4. **Program ends**: After executing all statements, the program finishes.

### Keywords and Concepts:
- **Comparison Operators**: Operators that compare two values. In this case, `>` checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- **String Interpolation**: Using `${}` to include the result of an expression within a string.

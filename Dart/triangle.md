### Rewritten Code:
```dart
void main() {
  // Printing a simple ASCII representation of a 3D shape
  print('   /|');   // First line of the shape
  print('  / |');   // Second line of the shape
  print(' /  |');   // Third line of the shape
  print('/___|');   // Base line of the shape
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

#### 1. `void main()`
- **`void`**: As mentioned earlier, this indicates that the `main` function does not return a value.
- **`main`**: The entry point of the program where execution starts.

#### 2. `print(...)`
- **`print`**: A built-in function that outputs text to the console. It can take strings (text) or other data types as input.
- **String Literals**: Each `print` statement outputs a string that visually represents a part of an ASCII shape. 

### Each Print Statement:
1. **`print('   /|');`**
   - Outputs the first line of the shape with leading spaces for alignment.

2. **`print('  / |');`**
   - Outputs the second line, continuing the shape structure.

3. **`print(' /  |');`**
   - Outputs the third line, maintaining the shape's visual representation.

4. **`print('/___|');`**
   - Outputs the base of the shape, completing the ASCII art.

#### 3. **Whitespace in Strings**
- The spaces before the `/` in each string are crucial for maintaining the shape's appearance. They ensure proper alignment when printed to the console.

#### 4. **Semicolons `;`**
- Each statement ends with a semicolon, which is necessary to indicate the end of that specific command.

### Dry Run: Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Program starts**: 
   The Dart environment begins execution by calling the `main()` function.
   
2. **First Statement**:
   - `print('   /|');` is executed first, displaying:
     ```
       /|
     ```

3. **Second Statement**:
   - `print('  / |');` is executed next, displaying:
     ```
      / |
     ```

4. **Third Statement**:
   - `print(' /  |');` follows, displaying:
     ```
     /  |
     ```

5. **Fourth Statement**:
   - `print('/___|');` executes last, displaying:
     ```
     /___|
     ```

6. **Program ends**: 
   After executing all print statements, the program completes its execution.

### Execution Flow:
1. The Dart VM locates and executes the `main()` function.
2. Each print statement executes sequentially, outputting each line of the ASCII representation to the console.
3. The console displays the cumulative output as each line is printed.
4. The program finishes when all statements have been executed.

### Keywords and Concepts:
- **Sequential Execution**: Each line of code runs in the order it is written.
- **ASCII Art**: Using characters to create a visual representation, in this case, a 3D-like shape.
- **String Formatting**: The use of whitespace in strings to control the appearance of the output.

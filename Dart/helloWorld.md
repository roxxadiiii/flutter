### Rewritten Code:
```dart
void main() {
  // Calling the print function to display a message on the console
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

Now, let's break it down with a detailed explanation of each part:

### 1. `void main()`
- **`void`**: This is a **return type** in Dart, which indicates that the `main` function does not return any value. Functions in Dart can return a value, but when we use `void`, it means the function's purpose is solely to execute code and no result is sent back.
- **`main`**: This is the **entry point** of a Dart program. When a Dart program runs, the execution starts from the `main()` function, regardless of how many other functions or classes are defined.
- **Parentheses `()`**: Functions can take inputs in the form of parameters inside these parentheses. The `main` function here doesn’t take any arguments, so the parentheses are empty.

Example: 
If you had a function that adds two numbers, it would take inputs:
```dart
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### 2. `print('Hello, World!');`
- **`print`**: This is a built-in Dart function that sends output to the console. It is used for displaying messages or values during program execution. In this case, it prints the string `'Hello, World!'` to the console.
- **`'Hello, World!'`**: This is a string literal in Dart, enclosed in **single quotes**. Dart supports both single and double quotes for strings. Here, you’ve used single quotes, which is perfectly valid.

**String literals** represent sequences of characters. In this case, the string is simply the text `"Hello, World!"`.

### 3. **Semicolon `;`**
- Every statement in Dart must end with a semicolon. It tells the Dart interpreter that the statement is complete.

### Dry Run: Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Program starts**: 
   The Dart environment looks for the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program.
   
2. **First Statement**:
   The first (and only) statement inside `main()` is `print('Hello, World!');`.
   
3. **Execution of `print` function**:
   The built-in `print` function is invoked, which outputs the message `'Hello, World!'` to the console.
   
4. **Program ends**:
   Since there are no further statements to execute, the program finishes its execution.

### Execution Flow:
1. The Dart Virtual Machine (VM) or compiler initiates the program by looking for the `main()` function.
2. The `main()` function is called, and inside the function, the `print` function is executed with `'Hello, World!'` as the argument.
3. The `print` function sends the message to the console, and the program terminates successfully.

### Keywords and Concepts:
- **Function**: A block of code that performs a specific task when called. Here, `main()` is the function that the Dart runtime automatically calls.
- **Return Type**: `void` in this case, indicating that the function doesn’t return anything.
- **Built-in Function**: `print()` is a function provided by Dart to output data to the console.
- **String**: A sequence of characters, like `'Hello, World!'`, enclosed in single or double quotes.
